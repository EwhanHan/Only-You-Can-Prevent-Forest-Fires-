## Story

<p style='text-align: justify;'><em>Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires!</em> takes place in modern day where forest fires are becoming more and more prevalent due to public incompetence. Gary Lahey loves nature and became a park ranger so he could focus all his energy into protecting it. Gary was always known as somewhat of a buzzkill, hall monitor type, and he has brought that same personality to the campgrounds. Despite what people think about him, Gary will stop at nothing to ensure that his campgrounds remain in proper order. He spends all his day putting out metaphorical fires such as rowdy campers, drinking, and fishing without a permit while also battling literal fires on the campground.
